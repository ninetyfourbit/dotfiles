2014-10-27 20:22:31	henesy	you need help with linux on a macbook?
2014-10-27 20:23:16	henesy	and to answer your question, yes, bootloader on arch 
2014-10-27 20:23:19	henesy	get refind installed
2014-10-27 20:23:29	_glitch	Alright. Thanks. I've been trying to get it working all day
2014-10-27 20:23:29	henesy	then check your /efi directory for a tools folder
2014-10-27 20:23:40	henesy	make sure in the tools folder there is something for gptsync
2014-10-27 20:23:41	_glitch	refind on Arch or OSX?
2014-10-27 20:23:42	henesy	if there IS
2014-10-27 20:23:44	henesy	ARch
2014-10-27 20:23:47	henesy	er
2014-10-27 20:23:52	henesy	bootloader on arch
2014-10-27 20:23:57	henesy	 /efi on osx
2014-10-27 20:24:14	henesy	It's been awhile since I went through the whole process
2014-10-27 20:24:21	henesy	it was easier with Refit back in the day imho
2014-10-27 20:24:43	henesy	check the refind config file for a showtools entry of sorts, enable it, then put in the name of the gptsync in tools
2014-10-27 20:24:54	henesy	if you don't have gptsync I can throw a efi tool zip your way
2014-10-27 20:25:31	henesy	if the gptsync in /efi/tools or whatever is called gptsync_x86_64.efi the entry in the config for showtools or whatever would be gptsync_x86_64
2014-10-27 20:25:38	henesy	then you'd re-run the install.sh and all that
2014-10-27 20:25:42	henesy	once the config is updated
2014-10-27 20:25:42	henesy	reboot
2014-10-27 20:25:49	henesy	make sure it's there, it'll be an icon next to reboot and all of that
2014-10-27 20:25:53	henesy	if you're lucky it's there by default
2014-10-27 20:26:02	henesy	it'll be a little circle-arrow icon
2014-10-27 20:26:04	henesy	like a sync icon
2014-10-27 20:26:28	henesy	it drops to an efi shell, which then just running gptsync and letting it run it'll ask if you want to make a hybrid MBR/GPT you say yes
2014-10-27 20:26:35	henesy	and it'll align everything (hopefully for the better)
2014-10-27 20:28:18	henesy	you get all of that for OS X done, then just make a partition in disk utility, make it the size you want
2014-10-27 20:28:25	henesy	then reboot, gptsync the disk
2014-10-27 20:28:48	henesy	install arch or whatever to the said partition (you might need a second small partition for "reserved for bios" boot depending on how you do things)
2014-10-27 20:28:58	henesy	make sure to install a bootloader for arch
2014-10-27 20:29:05	henesy	reboot
2014-10-27 20:29:09	henesy	gptsync AGAIN (this one is especially important)
2014-10-27 20:29:11	henesy	then reboot again
2014-10-27 20:29:15	henesy	and it should show up in the menu
2014-10-27 20:29:19	henesy	it /might/ not boot the first time
2014-10-27 20:29:21	henesy	just let it sit for a bit
2014-10-27 20:29:24	henesy	force reboot and try again
2014-10-27 20:29:26	henesy	and it should work
2014-10-27 20:35:39	_glitch	I screencapped this. I can't try again tonight, too frustrated.
2014-10-27 20:35:59	henesy	I completely understand, it took many nights of frustration to learn the exact method
2014-10-27 20:36:06	henesy	It's an obnoxiously obtuse method
2014-10-27 20:36:48	henesy	I've been running *nix on my mac's since the first week I got them, so I can confirm that it can be done
2014-10-27 20:37:09	henesy	Primarily I ended up using Ubuntu (ew), mostly due to time restraints and I was used to debian and ubuntu worked out of the box with brightness etc
2014-10-27 20:37:31	henesy	Macbooks seem to have a habit of hating anything but hand-configuring brightness, backlights, sound, wireless, and lid suspend
2014-10-27 20:37:42	henesy	I had slackware running on here, so it can definitely be done with arch
2014-10-27 20:37:48	henesy	but it might require some hand-tweaking
2014-10-27 20:38:49	_glitch	I've had it working with Arch before, but I had to reinstall due to a hard drive crash. Now I can't get the damn thing to work for fuck all.
2014-10-27 20:40:05	_glitch	Earlier today it was because refind doesn't work with OS X 10.10 so I had to downgrade back to Mavericks, then refind wouldn't find my Arch install. I'm just gonna start fresh in the morning and hope I can get it working.
2014-10-27 20:40:42	henesy	gptsync
2014-10-27 20:40:45	henesy	that is most likely your answer
2014-10-27 20:40:57	henesy	if the partition map changes you can lose things like linux partitions from visibility
2014-10-27 20:41:06	henesy	alternatively, I had mavericks kill my partition once
2014-10-27 20:41:12	henesy	and I had to take some really out of the way path to fix it
2014-10-27 20:41:23	henesy	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1908210
2014-10-27 20:41:29	henesy	kind of an answer to the whole EFI thing
2014-10-27 20:41:41	henesy	I used that /once/ to fix stuff
2014-10-27 20:41:50	henesy	OS X 10.9+ is kinda sketchy
2014-10-27 20:41:58	henesy	and OS X upgrades like to kill refind
2014-10-27 20:42:20	_glitch	I keep everything backed up on a separate hard disk and online so reinstalling OSX or Linux isn't too bad, just a fucking hassle.
2014-10-27 20:43:06	_glitch	I'm actually sitting at 10.8 right now after the reinstall. Gonna get Arch running and then sit on OS X.
2014-10-27 20:46:05	_glitch	Fuck it. I'm doing it tonight.
2014-10-27 20:47:19	henesy	lol
2014-10-27 20:47:24	henesy	go for it man
2014-10-27 20:47:52	henesy	just gotta get refind working right
2014-10-27 20:47:56	henesy	then it's a cakewalk from there
2014-10-27 20:48:00	henesy	also never partition with disk utility
2014-10-27 20:48:02	henesy	after the initial blank one
2014-10-27 20:48:16	henesy	like holy shit disk utility sometimes becomes possessed and nukes partitions it doesn't know
2014-10-27 20:54:03	_glitch	I know. I just clear up space with it then use cgdisk for the rest
2014-10-27 20:55:57	henesy	Yeah, pretty much that
2014-10-27 20:57:42	_glitch	Oh. I do have a weird question
2014-10-27 20:58:10	henesy	sure?
2014-10-27 20:58:15	_glitch	The ESP -- should it be mounted at /boot? and if so, what fs-type?
2014-10-27 20:58:27	henesy	like
2014-10-27 20:58:29	henesy	the efi partition?
2014-10-27 20:58:42	_glitch	Yah. EFI Sytem Partition
2014-10-27 20:58:53	henesy	arch shouldn't touch the /dev/sda1 (first) partition that OS X uses
2014-10-27 20:58:56	henesy	never ever
2014-10-27 20:58:57	henesy	never never
2014-10-27 20:58:58	henesy	make your own
2014-10-27 20:59:02	henesy	like
2014-10-27 20:59:04	_glitch	That's what I'm asking about
2014-10-27 20:59:07	henesy	i've never made a efi partition
2014-10-27 20:59:09	henesy	yeah
2014-10-27 20:59:16	_glitch	Wait
2014-10-27 20:59:18	_glitch	Hold on
2014-10-27 20:59:20	henesy	you can just get a /boot partition or make a bios reserved partition
2014-10-27 20:59:40	_glitch	I know to make an EFI Partition. Should it be mounted to /boot?
2014-10-27 21:00:11	henesy	no
2014-10-27 21:00:15	henesy	not as far as i know
2014-10-27 21:00:20	henesy	i've never made an efi partition for mine
2014-10-27 21:00:41	_glitch	So just a root and home partition?
2014-10-27 21:00:50	henesy	root, home, yeah
2014-10-27 21:00:53	henesy	i get away with that usually
2014-10-27 21:01:00	henesy	i've had fedora and ubuntu complain about not making a BIOS partition
2014-10-27 21:01:02	henesy	which i did a few times
2014-10-27 21:01:06	henesy	but hell if i know what that is
2014-10-27 21:01:13	henesy	i don't think i technically need it
2014-10-27 21:02:38	_glitch	Alright. Just making sure. So which bootloader do you use on arch? GRUB?
2014-10-27 21:04:23	henesy	GRUB, yeah
2014-10-27 21:04:26	henesy	i prefer lilo usually
2014-10-27 21:04:32	henesy	but if there's any automation at all i'll do grub
2014-10-27 21:05:15	_glitch	I'll be back in a bit. I gotta lay my kid down
2014-10-27 21:06:26	henesy	Sure thing man
2014-10-27 21:13:37	_glitch	Alright. So, I still had Arch installed. I'll remove the boot partition and install GRUB
2014-10-27 21:15:36	henesy	(nod)
2014-10-27 21:15:38	henesy	sounds good
2014-10-27 21:18:15	_glitch	Wait. Do I need just grub or grub-efi-x86_64 ?
2014-10-27 21:18:37	henesy	I've always just used grub...but it might be symlinked by the distro of the moment, but I believe just GRUB
2014-10-27 21:23:26	_glitch	So for installation, what should the target be? I blieve i386 is for bios, right?
2014-10-27 21:24:52	henesy	I suppose
2014-10-27 21:24:54	henesy	ike
2014-10-27 21:24:59	henesy	if EFI for mac is /dev/sda1
2014-10-27 21:25:03	henesy	and mac is /dev/sda2
2014-10-27 21:25:10	henesy	then the mac backup is /dev/sda3
2014-10-27 21:25:14	henesy	linux should be like
2014-10-27 21:25:16	henesy	/dev/sda4
2014-10-27 21:25:17	henesy	linux root
2014-10-27 21:25:22	henesy	unless you want a boot partition
2014-10-27 21:25:29	henesy	but the boot partition must have boot flag on
2014-10-27 21:25:37	_glitch	No, I mean should the target be i386 or x86_64?
2014-10-27 21:25:46	henesy	64 for sure
2014-10-27 21:25:53	henesy	macs are x86_64
2014-10-27 21:27:53	_glitch	From the wiki: --target=i386-pc instructs grub-install to install for BIOS systems only. It is recommended to always use this option to remove ambiguity in grub-install.
2014-10-27 21:28:42	_glitch	The options are i386-efi, i386-pc, x86_64-efi. Probably the last one>?
2014-10-27 21:29:12	_glitch	And it compains about a lack of EFI directory
2014-10-27 21:29:43	henesy	oh okay
2014-10-27 21:29:46	henesy	yeah the last one
2014-10-27 21:29:49	henesy	lack of EFI...fff
2014-10-27 21:29:55	henesy	that might be the "reserved" partition
2014-10-27 21:30:14	henesy	but yes I would assume the last one
2014-10-27 21:30:21	_glitch	so --efi-directory should be /dev/sda1?
2014-10-27 21:30:34	henesy	Erm
2014-10-27 21:30:36	henesy	I suppose
2014-10-27 21:30:40	henesy	well
2014-10-27 21:30:41	henesy	i mean
2014-10-27 21:30:43	henesy	i've never used
2014-10-27 21:30:44	_glitch	Hold up
2014-10-27 21:30:47	henesy	os x's efi
2014-10-27 21:30:49	henesy	so i'd say no
2014-10-27 21:31:03	henesy	but I've never messed with an EFI partition at install
2014-10-27 21:31:20	_glitch	When you installed grub, do you remember what command you used?
2014-10-27 21:32:17	henesy	grub-install to /dev/sda1 or whatever the grub2 modern equivalent is
2014-10-27 21:32:33	henesy	i have to pop open the grub2 man page every time I use it becuase it's not gold grub
2014-10-27 21:32:35	henesy	*old
2014-10-27 21:32:54	_glitch	I'm still fairly new to linux so GRUB2 is my old grub
2014-10-27 21:33:45	_glitch	Ah fuck it. IT's a tomorrow thing. What timezone are you in?
2014-10-27 21:35:13	henesy	CST
2014-10-27 21:35:18	henesy	but I have classes most of tomorrow
2014-10-27 21:35:22	henesy	grub2 is pretty new
2014-10-27 21:35:29	henesy	you can google "how to install grub2"
2014-10-27 21:35:41	henesy	 /usually/ returns some kind of useful result
2014-10-27 21:37:03	_glitch	Alright. I'll give it a go then. So it's 19:37 there then?
2014-10-27 21:37:19	henesy	20:37
2014-10-27 21:37:23	henesy	but yeah
2014-10-27 21:37:37	henesy	i'll be on ~17:00 my time or so
2014-10-27 21:37:38	_glitch	Oh. Right. I forget to calculate EDT/EST. Fucking dst
2014-10-27 21:37:42	henesy	lol
2014-10-27 21:38:00	henesy	Worst case scenario I'm not on until 18:00 CST tomorrow
2014-10-27 21:38:07	_glitch	It seriously needs to be removed.
2014-10-27 21:38:11	henesy	Yeah.
2014-10-27 21:38:13	henesy	DST is bullshit
2014-10-27 21:38:31	_glitch	I should be on most of tomorrow. Probably around 10:00 CST until 21:00 CST
2014-10-27 21:38:52	henesy	Cool beans man, I might be spotty on and off
2014-10-27 21:39:25	henesy	I'll try to lend help when I can, wish ya well
2014-10-27 21:39:25	_glitch	Alright. Shouldn't be a need unless I want to punch my macbook in it's hard drive.. or.. RAM... or... Whatever the computer equivalent of the nuts is.
2014-10-27 21:40:19	henesy	cpu = brain, hard drive = brain, ram = shittier brain, graphics card = ???
2014-10-27 21:40:32	_glitch	eyes?
2014-10-27 21:41:05	henesy	I suppose, but webcam?
2014-10-27 21:41:17	_glitch	gpu=retinas?
2014-10-27 21:41:22	henesy	makes sense
2014-10-27 21:41:39	_glitch	I suppose the screws holding it together?
2014-10-27 21:42:10	henesy	that would make sense
2014-10-27 21:42:26	_glitch	Unless it literally has nuts and bolts.. But not on the MBP..
2014-10-27 21:45:14	henesy	Heh
2014-10-27 21:45:20	henesy	my pro has served me well
2014-10-27 21:45:28	henesy	but linux + pro = bleh
2014-10-27 21:45:58	_glitch	Wait, MBP or a Desktop Mac Pro?
2014-10-27 21:57:13	henesy	MBP
2014-10-27 21:57:29	henesy	I have a MBP ~2011ish and a Macbook Unibody from ~2009
2014-10-27 21:58:01	_glitch	Macbook Unibody?
2014-10-27 22:00:16	henesy	White shell, pre-metal
2014-10-27 22:00:24	henesy	really terrible plastic
2014-10-27 22:00:30	_glitch	Oh shit. I remember those.
2014-10-27 22:00:54	_glitch	For the time, they looked good but as soon as they started with the aluminum, fugetaboudit
2014-10-27 22:00:56	henesy	I accidentally drilled a hole on it by accident with a pen in class one day not paying attention and just fiddling
2014-10-27 22:01:08	_glitch	Lol.
2014-10-27 22:01:09	henesy	how do i words
2014-10-27 22:01:16	henesy	the plastic is insanely soft
2014-10-27 22:01:21	henesy	and melts really easily
2014-10-27 22:01:21	_glitch	words? 'fugetaboudit'?
2014-10-27 22:01:26	henesy	pretty much
2014-10-27 22:01:40	_glitch	forget-about-it
2014-10-27 22:01:51	henesy	in the wise style of ruby puts "words #{words['fugetaboudit']}"
2014-10-27 22:02:05	henesy	and words as in I said accidentally twice
2014-10-27 22:02:19	_glitch	Oh. Accidentally accident
2014-10-27 22:02:24	henesy	yeah :P
2014-10-27 22:04:28	_glitch	So what are you into?
2014-10-27 22:04:35	_glitch	As in life, I mean.
2014-10-27 22:04:41	_glitch	Not sex.
2014-10-27 22:04:45	_glitch	Y'know
2014-10-27 22:06:30	henesy	Linux stuff, vidya games casually, tabletop games, I enjoy passively fiddling around with "toy"s like kali linux and entered the arch world through blackarch
2014-10-27 22:06:49	henesy	i program mostly for utility and recreation
2014-10-27 22:06:55	henesy	making the occasional tool/script for myself
2014-10-27 22:07:36	_glitch	tabletop like Settler of Catan or like Monopoly?
2014-10-27 22:07:49	henesy	Settlers and shit
2014-10-27 22:08:46	_glitch	Nice. I've wanted to get into stuff like Risk and Settler and D&D but I have no friends to play with and my family is all 'fuck your shit, nobody wants to play fantasy'
2014-10-27 22:08:59	henesy	lol
2014-10-27 22:09:05	henesy	D&D is good fun, good for recreation
2014-10-27 22:09:15	henesy	roll20 is a good place to start as is reddit in general if you're looking for an online group
2014-10-27 22:09:22	henesy	risk is meh, look into Axis and Allies
2014-10-27 22:09:28	henesy	Settlers is cool, highly recommend
2014-10-27 22:09:54	_glitch	I've tried roll20 but I couldn't find one that fit my schedule. Also, I reddit every day. Usually in /r/MechanicalKeyboard and /r/TFTS
2014-10-27 22:10:00	henesy	lol
2014-10-27 22:10:02	henesy	that'll do it
2014-10-27 22:10:16	henesy	roll20 can be a bit jank sometimes
2014-10-27 22:10:32	henesy	there's a looking for group feature on a couple sites, but I don't do online too terribly often
2014-10-27 22:10:37	henesy	skype + roll20 is a fantastic resource
2014-10-27 22:10:59	_glitch	I found interesting options just nothing short enough. I only get a few hours and a 6-hour campaign was the shortest I found
2014-10-27 22:13:22	henesy	Ouch
2014-10-27 22:13:24	henesy	that's pretty insane
2014-10-27 22:13:29	henesy	the sessions I run are 2 hours if we're lucky
2014-10-27 22:13:37	henesy	but those are more or less dead at this point
2014-10-27 22:14:05	_glitch	Are there tabletop games for two that can be played over IRC?
2014-10-27 22:15:10	henesy	eehhhhh
2014-10-27 22:16:35	henesy	not really 
2014-10-27 22:16:35	henesy	they get absurdly complicated
2014-10-27 22:16:35	henesy	i've looked into making ssh-friendly buffered games for the cloud
2014-10-27 22:16:35	henesy	toss something into a VPS and run the "Server" and it works like the old bsd game hunt
2014-10-27 22:18:01	_glitch	Oh well. I'll just have to find some people and stuff them in my suv and tell them they will be free to go when we finish the campaign
2014-10-27 22:26:23	henesy	lol
2014-10-27 22:26:31	henesy	pretty much how we do it
2014-10-27 22:26:35	henesy	but we do it in pieces now and then
2014-10-27 22:27:12	_glitch	I just need others who haven't played and will learn.
2014-10-27 22:28:09	henesy	do you have a local gaming store?
2014-10-27 22:28:24	_glitch	We have a Gamestop two towns over.
2014-10-27 22:28:31	henesy	like
2014-10-27 22:28:35	henesy	tabletop
2014-10-27 22:28:44	henesy	most medium-sized cities have one
2014-10-27 22:28:48	henesy	or one pseudo-nearby
2014-10-27 22:29:33	_glitch	Maybe.. I haven't thought too much about it. I'll have to check into it.
2014-10-27 22:30:24	henesy	they're not always advertised well
2014-10-27 22:30:29	henesy	it's easy to have one slip by
2014-10-27 22:30:31	_glitch	Yeah..
2014-10-27 22:31:37	henesy	we apparently had two in town around here, but I didn't know about the other one, and there's a third one that popped up awhile back in some back corner with a small circle of friends who founded it
2014-10-27 22:31:49	henesy	and unless I was in the right loops I would have never known
2014-10-27 22:32:08	_glitch	Cool. I'll really have to look around
2014-10-27 22:33:36	_glitch	Hey, mind taking a scrot? 
2014-10-27 22:34:07	henesy	of?
2014-10-27 22:34:32	_glitch	Current screen. I love seeing other people's desks
2014-10-27 22:35:03	henesy	sure...gimme a sec
2014-10-27 22:35:09	_glitch	Here's mine http://a.pomf.se/kxglbh.png
2014-10-27 22:41:01	henesy	http://a.pomf.se/rssjir.png
2014-10-27 22:42:40	henesy	nice desktop you got there
2014-10-27 22:43:26	_glitch	 Thanks. Yours is very.. red. I think I've seen yours on /r/unixporn
2014-10-27 22:43:43	henesy	you have not sadly, I go to unixporn to try to better myself
2014-10-27 22:43:51	henesy	I'm working on tweaking mine up to look nicer
2014-10-27 22:44:00	henesy	and red is a very accurate term, mostly so it's easy on the eyes in the dark
2014-10-27 22:44:32	_glitch	I like my orange for night time (#EA7D24)
2014-10-27 22:45:00	_glitch	http://www.color-hex.com/color/ea7d24 against the light black background (#151515) is nice.
2014-10-27 22:45:24	henesy	I wholly agree, If I still used dwm that'd be around what I'd use
2014-10-27 22:45:28	henesy	but probably still a bit more red/green
2014-10-27 22:45:57	_glitch	Ah. I forgot to show off my colors/info
2014-10-27 22:46:18	henesy	one of the two
2014-10-27 22:46:35	henesy	I think I already asked this
2014-10-27 22:47:04	_glitch	http://a.pomf.se/jzfwco.png -- colors and info. 
2014-10-27 22:47:11	_glitch	What did you think you might have already asked?
2014-10-27 22:47:37	henesy	but do you know anything about awesome WM?
2014-10-27 22:47:44	henesy	mainly how the menu's work
2014-10-27 22:47:59	_glitch	I used awesome before switching to bspwm. Do you mean the right-click menu?
2014-10-27 22:48:18	henesy	I have a sub-menu going off of the screen 
2014-10-27 22:48:18	henesy	yeah
2014-10-27 22:48:25	_glitch	Scrot?
2014-10-27 22:48:30	henesy	sec
2014-10-27 22:53:25	henesy	well scrot -c isn't liking me at all
2014-10-27 22:53:28	henesy	but
2014-10-27 22:53:31	henesy	i can confirm
2014-10-27 22:53:33	_glitch	-c?
2014-10-27 22:53:33	henesy	the top of the menu
2014-10-27 22:53:35	henesy	is off the screen
2014-10-27 22:53:38	henesy	-c = count
2014-10-27 22:53:39	henesy	i.e delay
2014-10-27 22:53:44	henesy	the top and bottom go off the screen
2014-10-27 22:53:47	_glitch	Isn't it -cd ?
2014-10-27 22:53:51	henesy	is it?
2014-10-27 22:53:56	_glitch	man scrot
2014-10-27 22:54:09	_glitch	no.
2014-10-27 22:54:13	_glitch	-d <sec>
2014-10-27 22:54:31	_glitch	-c displays the countdown, -d is the actual delay
2014-10-27 22:56:06	henesy	http://i.imgur.com/f9mD6Nj.png?1
2014-10-27 22:56:08	henesy	boom
2014-10-27 22:56:22	henesy	not using pomf.se because it makes me irrationally nervous
2014-10-27 22:57:10	_glitch	Why's 'at? 
2014-10-27 22:57:21	henesy	it's a domain...named pomf...in sweden
2014-10-27 22:57:31	henesy	kinda sketchy
2014-10-27 22:57:31	_glitch	?
2014-10-27 22:57:33	_glitch	Lol.
2014-10-27 22:57:57	_glitch	I use it because it's easy and reliable. Not to mention the script is so easy 'pomf ~/image.png' and you're done.
2014-10-27 22:58:27	_glitch	Anyway, you just need to add another submenu or getter a higher res screen. The menu is too big so it goes off-screen.
2014-10-27 22:58:47	henesy	Alright, I figured as much
2014-10-27 22:58:50	_glitch	Judging by the scrot, probably an 'rfidiot' submenu
2014-10-27 22:59:02	henesy	lol, yeah
2014-10-27 22:59:16	henesy	I can compress them down a bit, the menu was generated, hence the clutter
2014-10-27 22:59:48	_glitch	Ah. I used to generate menus when I used openbox but decided hand made was better.
2014-10-27 23:01:51	henesy	Thing is, blackarch repo has over 1k tools
2014-10-27 23:02:01	henesy	like holy shit i'm not manually entering those
2014-10-27 23:02:17	henesy	upstream 1k tools held at the bleeding edge (usually)
2014-10-27 23:03:15	_glitch	Lol. Yeah. Maybe someone has already done it? Search around a bit. 
2014-10-27 23:04:34	_glitch	Oh, and here's a script for imgur uploading: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ninetyfourbit/dotfiles/master/scripts/imgur.sh
2014-10-27 23:06:14	henesy	I searched excessively and found very little in terms of how awesome works, but thank you for the imgur link, i'll use it :D
2014-10-27 23:06:23	_glitch	I gotta go. I'll catch up with you tomorrow, mate.
2014-10-27 23:06:30	henesy	Aight, have a good one
2014-10-27 23:06:39	henesy	Hopefully we can get that mac straightened out
2014-10-27 23:06:57	_glitch	http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Awesome-menu_basics
2014-10-27 23:07:08	_glitch	Hope so. That's a link to the awesome wiki
2014-10-27 23:07:29	_glitch	Hope your menu gets fixed. I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
2014-10-27 23:07:53	--	irc: disconnected from server
2014-10-28 20:08:54	henesy	oiiii
2014-10-28 20:09:00	henesy	how's it goin
2014-10-28 20:09:08	_glitch	Got Arch installed. Took all fuckin day
2014-10-28 20:09:18	henesy	But it works? 
2014-10-28 20:09:30	_glitch	So far. I'm at the login screen lol.
2014-10-28 20:09:35	_glitch	I literally JUST finished
2014-10-28 20:09:37	henesy	lol, that's awesome
2014-10-28 20:09:49	henesy	What steps did you end up taking? 
2014-10-28 20:10:15	henesy	btw, the arch wiki is severely outdated in terms of macbooks and such, i'm sure a contribution even if just a list of what to do would be much appreciated
2014-10-28 20:10:26	_glitch	I installed refind on OS X, didn't touch any configs. MAde a /root and /home partition, no /boot, no ESP, nothing. Then followed the 9,2 guide on the wiki... 
2014-10-28 20:10:39	henesy	oh okay
2014-10-28 20:10:44	henesy	easier way than i did it
2014-10-28 20:10:57	_glitch	Oh, I added the Note About 9,1 in it when I got it working last time.
2014-10-28 20:11:15	henesy	Awesome, you rock man
2014-10-28 20:11:20	henesy	glad to hear it went well
2014-10-28 20:11:31	_glitch	Yeah. Now time to install and copy my dotfiles.
2014-10-28 20:11:35	henesy	heh
2014-10-28 20:11:42	henesy	.vimrc, the first file I copy over ever
2014-10-28 20:14:44	_glitch	mine is my color files
2014-10-28 20:16:43	henesy	color? for terminal/desktop?
2014-10-28 20:33:44	_glitch	Yeah. 
2014-10-28 20:41:47	henesy	Niicceee
2014-10-28 20:41:58	henesy	really glad to hear it's working, sorry I wasn't much help
2014-10-28 20:42:26	_glitch	It's fine. I tried your way earlier but it didn't work.
2014-10-28 20:43:34	henesy	darn, sorry :\
2014-10-28 20:45:30	_glitch	IT's fine.. So, my dotfiles total 857.44 MiB
2014-10-28 20:48:40	henesy	Holy cow
2014-10-28 20:48:43	henesy	in just raw text?
2014-10-28 20:49:12	_glitch	No. Some PDFs and a lot of wallpapers
2014-10-28 20:49:39	_glitch	github.com/ninetyfourbit/dotfiles
2014-10-28 20:53:44	henesy	Ah okay, neat
2014-10-28 21:09:23	_glitch	 Know what else is neat? Getting the macbook finally set up lol
2014-10-28 21:15:32	henesy	lol
2014-10-28 21:15:36	henesy	fully functional and everything?
2014-10-28 21:15:40	henesy	that's pretty awesome
2014-10-28 21:15:51	henesy	I might give that a go in a couple weeks
2014-10-28 21:17:27	_glitch	Well, still cloning everything for bspwm but about to start the x server and hope for the best
2014-10-28 21:18:01	_glitch	Ah, fuckin' driver.
2014-10-28 21:18:06	_glitch	/s/driver/drivers
2014-10-28 21:21:44	_glitch	IT LIVES!
2014-10-28 21:26:37	henesy	AHA
2014-10-28 21:26:41	henesy	BEAUTIFUL
2014-10-28 21:27:17	henesy	Any drivers you had to manually install?
2014-10-28 21:27:45	_glitch	I forgot to install the 'nvidia' drivers and 'xf86-input-synaptics'
2014-10-28 21:46:09	henesy	ahhh yes
2014-10-28 21:46:11	henesy	that'll do it
2014-10-28 21:46:33	henesy	synaptics....i remember back when ubuntu 10.04 was out I had to manually mess with synaptics on my first macbook the first time I put linux on it
2014-10-28 21:46:43	henesy	for a supposed "easy" install that I could have up and running in <2 hours
2014-10-28 21:47:00	henesy	turned into how much anti-documentation can we find 
2014-10-28 21:47:34	_glitch	I'
2014-10-28 21:47:51	_glitch	ve never had much trouble with computer until this week
2014-10-28 21:50:35	henesy	Glad to hear it went smoothly though, I plan on installing arch on my macs at some point to succeed the wretched ubuntu that currently resides
2014-10-28 21:51:47	_glitch	Do you prefer Tiling or Floating?
2014-10-28 21:53:30	henesy	Tiling if I'm just working on my own/doing day-to-day stuff, floating if I'm working with a ton of windows/new GUI-reliant software
2014-10-28 21:53:34	henesy	namely things with pop-ups
2014-10-28 21:54:18	henesy	coding/day-to-day I by far prefer tiling, great for "Getting in the zone"
2014-10-28 21:54:24	_glitch	Are you using Unity on Ubuntu?
2014-10-28 21:55:49	henesy	If I'm in classes I do, only because I know everything on it will "work" if I suddenly have to hook up to a projector etc. Otherwise, I'm bouncing around, I used enlightenment for a bit, but want to get dwm/awesome or something else running smoothly
2014-10-28 21:55:53	henesy	haven't had the time to do it mostly
2014-10-28 21:56:01	henesy	I use awesome on a thinkpad and a desktop
2014-10-28 21:56:09	henesy	everything else is headless or running ubuntu
2014-10-28 21:56:31	_glitch	headless?
2014-10-28 21:56:35	_glitch	No WM/DE?
2014-10-28 21:56:38	henesy	servers
2014-10-28 21:56:52	henesy	and I'll just open ssh to them 
2014-10-28 21:56:57	_glitch	Ah. So what arr you going to school for?
2014-10-28 21:57:14	henesy	Computer Science/Computer Engineering
2014-10-28 21:57:25	henesy	the majority of the server things are for compatibility/hosting
2014-10-28 21:57:37	henesy	for example some software relies on gnutls 2.x rather than the current 3.x
2014-10-28 21:57:51	henesy	and I can just have vm's run out of a headless server
2014-10-28 21:57:59	henesy	to host said services
2014-10-28 21:59:53	henesy	though now that you mention WM's, I might just make tunneled VNC sessions for dwm or something similarly lightweight
2014-10-28 22:22:40	_glitch	Sorry. I was getting my colors straightened out
2014-10-28 22:23:47	henesy	You're fine man, I'm pretty busy myself
2014-10-28 22:24:36	_glitch	Alright, man. Thanks for the help with the macbook
2014-10-28 22:29:33	henesy	Sorry I couldn't help more, glad everything worked out.
2014-10-28 22:29:40	henesy	always a pleasure to help when possible
