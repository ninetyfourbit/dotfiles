2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- was in England where he was educated and spent most of
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- his life.  Orwell is perhaps best known for his novels

2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	-
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- exposed.
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	-
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- other service.
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	-
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	-
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	- passwords again after analysis has completed.
2014-10-24 17:51:57	--	-
