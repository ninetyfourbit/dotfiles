2014-10-31 10:02:33	cpeepee	So basically when my finger gets close enough to a physical object the feeling of touch I recieve when I press my finger against it is the electromagnetic force between the atoms of my finger and the atoms of said object?
2014-10-31 10:02:33	pyon	cpeepee: Saying "particles are never physically adjacent to each other" would be correct, though.

2014-10-31 10:06:29	_W_	cpeepee: but a finger hovering over a key is also "next to" the key
2014-10-31 10:06:30	cpeepee	I suspect they're really in the same location but it only appears different to us
2014-10-31 10:06:35	pyon	ssta: I must admit my ignorance regarding quarks. All I know is that protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each.
2014-10-31 10:06:38	cpeepee	Yeah W
2014-10-31 10:06:46	cpeepee	it's just a matter of how close
2014-10-31 10:06:58	cpeepee	"next to" is kind of a blanket term in terms of distance
2014-10-31 10:07:01	ssta	pyon: at that level uncertainty makes it hard to say where exactly they are anyway :)
2014-10-31 10:07:06	_W_	pulse: that's not true in the way you mean it, I suspect

2014-10-31 10:07:54	pulse	pyon, my point is can you formulate a set of words that will explain to this blind person what color is?
2014-10-31 10:07:58	pulse	if you can't, this proves my argument
2014-10-31 10:08:08	ihatehex	pulse: that is logically erroneous

2014-10-31 10:08:33	cpeepee	which is interesting
2014-10-31 10:08:55	pulse	ihatehex, er, what?
2014-10-31 10:08:57	pyon	pulse: Furthermore, if surgery can restore sight, it is further evidence that sight is just a physical thing.
2014-10-31 10:09:01	phore	ooh, are we talking about how language influences thought?
2014-10-31 10:09:23	pulse	pyon, eh, you're missing my point. which is surprising, given that you gave me a nice summary of it not long ago.
2014-10-31 10:09:24	ihatehex	a) you can easily formulate that, they just won't be able to experience it
2014-10-31 10:09:34	ihatehex	b) your point that 'if you can't, this proves my argument' is bullshit

2014-10-31 11:36:47	rfreeman_w	Denommus, as for arguments: if then people needed 500 to survive, and 1000 to live somewhat normally,  you would set minwage to say 800, this means people who's work is worth 700 would find themselves earning 0 and dying (or probably, instead, stealing and working on black market)

It is a concolic testing suite, but it uses the YICES SMT solver for its prover/backend.  YICES isn't FLOSS though.  I was wondering if anyone has had any luck trying to get CREST to use a different FLOSS SMT solver, like Alt-ergo?
