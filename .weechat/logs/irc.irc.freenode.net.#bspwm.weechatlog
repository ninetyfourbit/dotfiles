2014-10-24 17:06:46	natanvarga	most of it is stolen haha
2014-10-24 17:07:17	natanvarga	im running manjaro and there was a guy sometime ago who shared his bspwm/dzen2 configs so i just slightly altered his
2014-10-24 17:07:21	o_caino	try  PANEL_FONT="current-font,other-font", just a couple of quotes
2014-10-24 17:08:13	_glitch	Is there a way to refresh it without restarting Xserver?
2014-10-24 17:08:37	o_caino	the panel?
2014-10-24 17:08:45	o_caino	or the variable?
2014-10-24 17:09:03	_glitch	I suppose bspwm, since it's in the .bspwmrc file
2014-10-24 17:09:48	o_caino	bspwmrc is a bash script (I'm always repeating the same...)
2014-10-24 17:10:37	o_caino	if you want to test just open a terminal, set the variables and rerun the panel from the same terminal

2014-10-28 18:00:23	o_caino	life is easier without panels or bars
2014-10-28 18:03:43	toketin	o_caino: you can't know your battery level or the time :P
2014-10-28 18:04:29	o_caino	my battery is dead, so it's always plugged :D
2014-10-28 18:05:47	toketin	it would be better if bswpw had supported a kind of i3bar or i3status

2014-10-28 18:10:13	o_caino	bspwm's status information is an elegant and versatile solution to create whatever notification system, bar or panel you want
2014-10-28 18:12:56	toketin	a bit more difficult to handle than the i3bar/status ecc syntax imho

2014-10-29 19:16:21	o_caino	bspwm has two layouts: monocle and tiled.
2014-10-29 19:37:56	iskatu	Ok, so that means that either all windows are visible or one is shown in fullscreen, right? I cant somehow move individual windows in the background if I dont need them?
2014-10-29 19:46:47	o_caino	right. I don't understand the concept of "background" in a tiling wm
2014-10-29 20:06:51	iskatu	I think of it more as subworkspaces. Quite useful on small monitors.
2014-10-29 20:08:03	o_caino	you can have as many workspaces as you want. if you don't need a window and don't want to see it move it to another workspace

2014-10-29 20:46:43	_glitch	I was just curious as to what your setup looked like currently.
2014-10-29 20:48:00	o_caino	my setup is very basic: no panels, no trays...
2014-10-29 20:48:22	_glitch	What are trays?
2014-10-29 20:48:30	_glitch	I use bar for my panel
