2014-10-25 21:20:59	iron_hou1	I am taking a python class at my university and I'm doing quite well, thanks to the great help I've been getting here. The course is arranged so that we have to do peer reviews. My problem is that I have to drag my way through horrible code. Python written like it's some nasty C program with if-statements running deep and wide and mile long functions .. How can I get my fellow student to understand how to
2014-10-25 21:21:01	iron_hou1	write nice code? This isn't just a matter of using Python correctly, this is about horrible design as well. What can I write to this person that will get him to understand how to write good code?
