2014-11-06 18:17:45	FiXato	yeah, that should have trigger. Do you only autoload a limited amount of plugins?

2014-11-06 18:18:04	azizLIGHT	yes
2014-11-06 18:18:18	azizLIGHT	so i disabled it i guess
2014-11-06 18:18:47	FiXato	then you'll probably have to add trigger to the autoload list if you want to use it ;)
2014-11-06 18:20:41	azizLIGHT	where are the plugins stored
2014-11-06 18:21:30	azizLIGHT	i dont see them in the language dirs
2014-11-06 18:21:44	azizLIGHT	dirs like perl or python in ~/.weechat

2014-11-06 18:23:03	azizLIGHT	nvm i just set weechat.plugins.autolaod

2014-11-06 18:25:29	FiXato	/plugin load trigger
2014-11-06 18:26:27	FiXato	the 'language' dirs only contain scripts, not plugins
2014-11-06 18:32:31	dtch	FiXato: Thank you. How do you clear the chat window?
2014-11-06 18:33:07	FiXato	you don't. you clear the buffer instead
2014-11-06 18:33:14	FiXato	/help buffer
2014-11-06 18:33:48	xt	you can also type
2014-11-06 18:33:54	xt	/quit
2014-11-06 18:34:41	xt	look how nice, the weechat quit prevention stopped me from quitting. you can type /quit without actually quitting!
2014-11-06 18:40:55	FiXato	dtch: did you find /buffer clear yet?
2014-11-06 18:41:17	FiXato	or the default alias /c
