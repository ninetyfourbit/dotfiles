2014-10-23 11:07:51	Rachu	So i have to define a function with the first paramater given as a list[], the second as a str and the third as a number. The function should return true if the length of the list == length of str == int(number). I am not sure what the right syntax is so that python is able to count the items in the list properly.

Develop a clean, operational prototype, even if it's too slow. Focus on clean code. 2. Profile the code. 3. Optimise in order of what your profiler tells you.

2014-10-24 08:39:57	miyako	C is a very tiny language

2014-10-24 08:43:31	CaptainRant	jkbbwr: Python: dynamically typed. Java: just marginally better. The typesystem ensures that i can't pass an int as a string, but it doesn't guarrantee that i really get a string.

2014-10-24 08:45:45	jkbbwr	CaptainRant: honestly calling to C is trivial in modern java without writing much if any wrapping code
2014-10-24 08:45:49	Twey	miyako: As a PL guy, a core Haskell is easily specified (it's basically just System F with some syntax on top, and System F can be specified on a T-shirt), whereas C is a big, messy language with a bunch of interactions with its environment and undefined behaviour at every turn
2014-10-24 08:45:53	jkbbwr	CaptainRant: and again null safety use kotlin

2014-10-25 08:35:07	pyon	OCaml gives me immutable data types. (It also gives me mutable ones, but let's not talk about them now.)

2014-10-25 08:35:33	pyon	Now, the obvious payoff of using immutable data types is that you can parallelize anything that operates on them. For free.
2014-10-25 08:35:39	pyon	But OCaml doesn't have parallelism.
2014-10-25 08:35:47	perdent	Does anyone here write code using Scala? If you don't I'm interested in your reasons for not adopting Scala over Java. Scala seems like the language which offers many more easy to use features.
2014-10-25 08:35:48	pyon	So, basically, it's immutability without the benefits.
2014-10-25 08:36:28	pyon	perdent: If you use Scala as a better Java, your code will be more concise while still being clear and readable and nice.
2014-10-25 08:36:39	perdent	This Scala example takes a range of numbers and squares each and the sums the square. In Scala this is a simple exercise but if I remember correctly, doing something like this in Java is pretty cumbersome. http://pastebin.com/2KXY71Lr
2014-10-25 08:36:45	pyon	perdent: If you try to use Scala as a worse Haskell, you're opening the gates of hell.
2014-10-25 08:36:49	Isolol	java namespaces make my eyes bleed
2014-10-25 08:36:53	perdent	I would think a programmer would choose the language with the most features.
2014-10-25 08:37:21	pyon	perdent: The number of features in a language isn't what makes it good.
2014-10-25 08:37:34	pyon	perdent: Otherwise, Perl and C++11 would be the ultimate languages. (Although Scala would be probably pretty close.)

2014-10-25 08:43:05	Lymia	I'd say if nothing else, Java deserves credit for being simple and consistant, in its core language.
2014-10-25 08:43:10	pyon	Lymia: Java's main weak points are value semantics (where it totally sucks) and lack of resource management facilities (where it doesn't do worse than most other languages anyway).
2014-10-25 08:43:26	perdent	pyon, What do you think the main advantages og Scala over Java are?
2014-10-25 08:43:33	perdent	Of*
2014-10-25 08:43:49	pyon	perdent: Primarily expressivity.
2014-10-25 08:43:55	Lymia	A type system that's more on the side of "helps you" than "gets in your way"
2014-10-25 08:44:21	pyon	perdent: Scala's traits are a huge improvement over mere interfaces.
2014-10-25 08:44:45	pyon	perdent: Also, Scala's type members (types as members of objects) are a lot smarter than Java's inner classes.

2014-10-25 11:21:12	ssta	hellyeah: sure, it's (relatively) new (well, it's been around for a long time, but it's only recently getting attention)
2014-10-25 11:21:16	hellyeah	i saw you can do fp in java too
2014-10-25 11:21:49	ssta	hellyeah: FP is a paradigm, you can do it almost anywhere...it's a way of thinking.  Some languages lend themselves to the paradigm better than others
2014-10-25 11:22:03	hellyeah	gotcha
2014-10-25 11:22:34	hellyeah	speaking of oop can you suggest me good, detail sources. I know well about oop but i should read something. I am currently c#
2014-10-25 11:22:34	bacon1989	yeah, I wouldn't claim that functional programming wasn't popular before
2014-10-25 11:22:54	hellyeah	btw c is imperative language right
2014-10-25 11:22:58	bacon1989	languages like haskell are considered 'purely functional'
2014-10-25 11:23:58	ssta	hellyeah: largely, yes...but you can do OO or FP in C if you want (it's just tricky and demands that the programmer ensures constraints that are guaranteed by the language in other languages)

2014-10-25 11:27:19	ssta	in 20 years when the younger guys who are brought up to thinking like that are the managers who make the decisions, it will shift
2014-10-25 11:27:20	hellyeah	It will be just same if you do correctly what you do

2014-10-25 11:28:38	ssta	hellyeah: code written in C++ is going to be significantly faster than code written in say python (as long as both are written with the same algorithms)
2014-10-25 11:28:44	hellyeah	actually i trey to say in one language. You can use some technique but probably performance will be more or less
2014-10-25 11:29:02	hellyeah	i möeant in one language
2014-10-25 11:29:14	hellyeah	i am not an expert but let say
2014-10-25 11:29:23	worfox	well, in C/Java/C++ you can't to recursive code that well for example. iirc.
2014-10-25 11:29:39	hellyeah	with boxing technique or normal technique there is no real difference in compile time

2014-10-25 11:31:19	ssta	hellyeah: oh,. for real speedups you need different algorithms.  But honestly, StringBuilder *can* be a huge speed increase over String for some tasks
2014-10-25 11:31:45	worfox	ssta: No tail-recursion elimination, right?
2014-10-25 11:32:09	hellyeah	ssta:  YOU mean string concat=
2014-10-25 11:32:14	ssta	worfox: I think most optimisers will do that, but I'm not sure
2014-10-25 11:32:20	hellyeah	?
2014-10-25 11:32:34	hellyeah	btw tail recursion are faster than recursion
2014-10-25 11:32:45	ssta	hellyeah: yes.  For joining lots of strings together StringBuilder is a defiunite gain over just adding them
2014-10-25 11:32:50	hellyeah	iteration and tail recursion should have save performance
2014-10-25 11:33:04	ssta	hellyeah: tail recursion is (essentially) iteration.

2014-10-25 11:34:58	ssta	it also allows optimisations in the compiler/JIT
2014-10-25 11:35:04	hellyeah	i mean gc can handle managed source.
2014-10-25 11:35:17	xeno	you're talking about java's StringBuilder?

2014-10-25 11:36:06	xeno	at least in java, "a"+"b"+"c" is just translated into new StringBuilder("a").append("b").append("c").toString() by the compiler

2014-10-25 11:37:06	hellyeah	is it true to say working with immutable type is better?
2014-10-25 11:37:21	xeno	which is why things like 'for (String a: myCollection) resultString += a;' is so disastrous, and why sb.append("a"+"b") is also pretty bad
2014-10-25 11:37:24	hellyeah	or it depends?
2014-10-25 11:37:25	worfox	bytefire: Easily jumping in your code/autocompletion for me.
2014-10-25 11:37:36	ssta	xeno: would it correctly optimise: String s = ""; for (int x='A'; x<'Z'; x++) { s+=x; } ?

2014-10-25 11:38:03	ssta	or make it char in the loop
2014-10-25 11:38:11	bytefire	hellyeah, yes. mainly because of protection from multiple threads accessing the data abdending in race conditions
2014-10-25 11:38:15	xeno	everyone stopped doing things like that back then, so I guess no one really thinks about it anymore...

2014-10-25 12:06:50	titanium17	so i have a loop in my primary class, that invokes a thread for each iteration
2014-10-25 12:07:07	titanium17	then using the current loop counter, i pass it to the thread, and I have to compute the value of the pixel

2014-10-25 12:47:44	Twey	CaptainRant: With a dependent type system you can express arbitrarily complex invariants about the results of functions; with a linear or other substructural type system you can also express invariants about the *behaviour* of functions (runtime, complexity, &c.).  How much effort it takes to express them depends on the complexity of the invariant.  There are some invariants that are unproveable and
2014-10-25 12:47:46	Twey	therefore impossible to express in any system, but thankfully they're quite unusual
2014-10-25 12:47:56	Twey	CaptainRant: Oh, that's just typing

2014-10-25 12:48:35	CaptainRant	And how to implement True ? Is it its own, anonyme type ?
2014-10-25 12:48:48	qis	Right now there is no way to hide something digital from NSA. Even if you encrypt it, it will be stored until it can be decrypted with quantum computers or whatever. That's my worst case assumption at least.
2014-10-25 12:48:55	CaptainRant	I can do option types simply by tagged unions.

2014-10-25 15:00:20	worfox	That's still a bad thing.
2014-10-25 15:00:24	qis	Correct.
2014-10-25 15:00:39	Twey	qis: But you *can* be prevented from stabbing a random person — in the abstract even if it's not necessarily always enforceable.  The police have a right to stop you stabbing someone; the person being stabbed has a right to fight back; even any bystanders who might happen to be around are well within their rights to stop you stabbing someone.
2014-10-25 15:00:41	wz1000	qis: Anyone can prevent you from stabbing a random person. They are just not effective at doing so.

2014-10-25 15:01:27	Twey	qis: This is because the law in your country (presumably :þ) does not protect your positive freedom to stab people, instead preferring to protect other people's negative freedom from being stabbed.
2014-10-25 15:01:48	qis	It's not a negative freedom.
2014-10-25 15:01:56	qis	It's a positive freedom of staying alive.

2014-10-25 15:02:35	Twey	qis: A positive freedom is a freedom to deliberately choose to do something; a negative freedom is a freedom from being interfered with in the course of doing something else
2014-10-25 15:02:36	qis	But that freedom does not exist in all countries. Look at the US states with capital punishment.

2014-10-25 15:31:20	diprosopus	I mean, if the loop jumps 10 times, then an extra two won't make a huge difference.

2014-10-25 17:04:06	Shayanjm	pyon: functionally it's a similar concept - data comes in in one form, data goes out in another
2014-10-25 17:04:09	pyon	Shayanjm: It's primarily about programming against algebraic structures that need to satisfy general laws and nothing else.
2014-10-25 17:04:11	Shayanjm	'pure' functions act the same way
2014-10-25 17:04:19	hyuke	pyon: possibly. It took me a little while to really grasp OO programming well and I still don't like it much. I suppose learning FP is probably no bigger learning curve, it's just different
2014-10-25 17:04:55	hyuke	Lymia, I don't think classes should be nested more than 4-5 levels deep. They start becoming incomprehensible ;/
2014-10-25 17:05:14	pyon	hyuke: OO is rather fuzzy. Different OO languages have very different ideas of what objects are.

2014-10-26 19:09:53	Seabasschan	paulo_: Sure. Sometimes it can be good to reinvent the wheel, for example when the wheel doesn't have a certain set of features and implementing those features on top of the wheel would prove equally painful to reinventing the wheel. Other times, however, it's more work to reinvent the wheel than to tack those features onto the wheel. It's a case-by-case decision as to whether reinventing
2014-10-26 19:09:54	Seabasschan	the wheel is appropriate (usually not).

If everyone just says "ah, just use xyz, don't reinvent the wheel", then you don't get the helpful discussion you need.

They're all home-grown, the kind that move aimlessly rather than following a path, and capture the rendered UI to determine where to aim. Rendering sucks when it's required for bots.

The "parameter" would be the width of the rectangles. If you examine the limit of this where the width of the rectangles goes to 0, you have an infinitely precise approximation, and essentially you have computed the actual area under this curve

2014-10-27 13:43:08	CaptainRant	xeno: so if the compiler can decide whats better, how do you know what the user means with loadUp("foo.lua"); ? Does he mean foo.lua from the project dir?

2014-10-27 13:46:56	Twey	Right
2014-10-27 13:47:13	Twey	Executing arbitrary Turing-complete code has some interesting consequences for the results of compiling code

2014-10-27 13:47:27	Twey	But it's not hard
2014-10-27 13:48:00	Twey	If you want to distinguish between arbitrary Turing-complete code and pure, terminating code, a good place to do that is the type system
2014-10-27 13:48:21	CaptainRant	Twey: in the main file of your program, passed values are almost always known at compile time.

2014-10-27 13:48:46	Twey	Then you can refuse to run things from the former set during compilation, if you like
2014-10-27 13:48:55	CaptainRant	So print("Hello") can be detected as: Everything to run is known statically.
2014-10-27 13:48:57	snyp	whats CTFE?
2014-10-27 13:49:03	Twey	xeno: Sure — that just puts you in the ‘arbitrary Turing-complete code’ category

2014-10-27 13:49:57	Twey	CaptainRant: If you have an IO monad, for example, everything to *evaluate* it is available at compile-time, and can be done.  But *executing* it can still be deferred to runtime.
2014-10-27 13:50:05	CaptainRant	xeno: but he never knows whats inside of a function, if its entangled with C libs.

2014-10-27 14:24:53	extor	Is there any way of doing coding gigs without signing up at a miserable place like guru or freelancer? I'm assuming you have to be 1) Chummy with some well financed operation and 2) Extremely advanced in a narrow niche and/or with 10-20 years of experience turning out quality apps or 3) Willing to code for the "ewwww tier" operations like camwhore sites, spam factories and captcha farms?

2014-10-27 14:56:04	crazypyro	And it can go into any affinity/any victory condition so it makes every other strat inferior.

2014-10-27 17:48:12	lillian	Making a 2D game. I have a map, it's made up of graphical tiles which all have the same dimensions. I have two units of measurement for map coordinates: pixels and tiles. Each tile has a corresponding TileProperties which is simply a 1D list/array of strings like "impassable_all" and "is_water." If I allow the user to arbitrarily resize/scale the map, what formula can I use to reliably produce the 1D index which corresponds to a 2D pixel coord

2014-10-27 18:21:55	lillian	three tiles right and down would be (2, 2)

2014-10-28 13:18:38	guideX	someone I know does their versioning this way, making it useless: 9.99.9.01.20.2010.1000   (9.99.01 being the version, 01.20.2010 being the date, and 1000 being the svn version)

2014-10-28 13:20:36	Denommus	adsc: what I'm talking is different, though. Each equipment provides bonus and penalties for different circumstances, and each unit (even of the same type) can have a different equipment set

2014-10-29 21:28:29	Broolucks	we can't conceive consciousness to be a physical process because we are unable to properly understand what consciousness is

2014-10-29 21:41:20	Seapeepee	It's possible that to simulate a living organism is also to create one.

2014-10-30 18:06:56	nisstyre	if your program relies a lot on external data that is hard to manufacture, then it's going to be hard to test

Prior to the last minute, you want to be producing that overview manually so that you can unravell it.

2014-10-30 22:43:33	sdgsd	so are you saying if you know how to program a PIC chip , AVR , then then do rasberry pie , then  audrino the firmware/microcontrollers for the PLC based machines for the industries/manufacturing plants would be similar
2014-10-30 22:43:40	MINIMAN10000	i sorta assumed i did because i downloaded a compiler that included pthreads

2014-10-31 09:27:46	cpeepee	True, but I think you meant to transfer the feeling of an experience to a different mind, and actually that may be doable real soon, you know we have vulcan mind-meld technology now?

2014-10-31 09:27:59	pyon	pulse: How so?
2014-10-31 09:28:04	pulse	and reducing it doesn't justify it philosophically, at all.
2014-10-31 09:28:22	cpeepee	philosophy is just a subjective understanding of it though
2014-10-31 09:28:23	pulse	pyon, i gave you an example earlier. if you never felt fear, then how do i communicate to you what fear is?
2014-10-31 09:28:26	pyon	pulse: Mostly reductionist science has been pretty successful at describing the universe.
2014-10-31 09:28:34	pulse	pyon, from one side, yes
2014-10-31 09:28:34	AoE	They discovered internal gps of a mouse brain. https://blogs.princeton.edu/research/2013/03/06/researchers-discover-workings-of-brains-gps-system/    Maybe they can also prove some love exists to a certain point?
2014-10-31 09:28:37	_W_	pulse: pretend the word "just" wasn't there in the sentence - it's still an answer to your question
2014-10-31 09:28:40	pulse	but they fail altogether when describing, say, emotions

2014-10-31 09:28:49	pyon	pulse: You would find it extremely hard to find a person who never has felt fear.
2014-10-31 09:28:59	dducks	I have a C++ templated class, with something along the line
2014-10-31 09:29:00	pulse	_W_, still doesn't do mother's love justice.
2014-10-31 09:29:02	cpeepee	Emotions are the same thing mind is, just different.

2014-10-31 09:29:09	pulse	mother's love isn't a bunch of words, put together so they make sense.

2014-10-31 09:29:12	_W_	pulse: it doesn't have to
2014-10-31 09:29:17	sam	pulse: how did you learn the word fear? how did you know it was fear when you experienced fear?
2014-10-31 09:29:18	pyon	pulse: Babies are afraid for lots of reasons.
2014-10-31 09:29:20	_W_	pulse: all it has to is predict it
2014-10-31 09:29:21	pulse	_W_, i know it doesn't, that's my whole point
2014-10-31 09:29:23	dducks	oh
2014-10-31 09:29:24	dducks	nvm
2014-10-31 09:29:32	cpeepee	Do you think "mother's love" is more than just a survival trait?
2014-10-31 09:29:32	pulse	sam, good question but i have no idea
2014-10-31 09:29:37	sam	if you can define the qord and recognise it, you can explain it
2014-10-31 09:29:38	pulse	cpeepee, no shit
2014-10-31 09:29:49	_W_	again, science isn't about the words, it's about making predictions
2014-10-31 09:29:54	sam	-q+w
2014-10-31 09:30:11	cpeepee	"no shit" as in "I agree it's a survival trait and nothing more" or "No shit I believe it's more than that"?
2014-10-31 09:30:52	ssta	and observing the correctness of the predicitions
2014-10-31 09:30:53	ssta	that's the issue I have with string theory
2014-10-31 09:30:53	ssta	it makes no predictions
2014-10-31 09:31:07	pulse	cpeepee, did you ever love someone?
2014-10-31 09:31:14	pyon	ssta: String theory is arguably not science. At least not yet.

2014-10-31 09:31:25	pulse	did you ever love someone?
2014-10-31 09:31:38	cpeepee	I very often question what people eman by love
2014-10-31 09:31:40	cpeepee	that's why I asked
2014-10-31 09:31:40	pulse	say, your mother
2014-10-31 09:31:50	pulse	or father, or girlfriend, whatever
2014-10-31 09:31:55	pulse	did you ever feel real love is what i'm asking you?
2014-10-31 09:32:00	ssta	pyon: well, it's fairly consistent mathematically (AIUI), but until it can make verifiable predictions it's closer to philosophy than science
