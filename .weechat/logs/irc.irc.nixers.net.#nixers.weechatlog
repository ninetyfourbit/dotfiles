2014-11-06 12:45:03	@dami	wasn't 2bwm a fork of bspwm?
2014-11-06 12:45:07	kirby	There's a magical thing called the source code, you should look at it :p

2014-11-06 13:48:46	_glitch	My boss is both the best and the worst. Long hours, but I can take two 1-hr breaks. Really random hours.. But usually he gets a pizza on Fridays for us all.
2014-11-06 13:52:41	_glitch	Plus there's the perk of being able to do literally anything I want at work. I can just walk to the fridge and grab a beer if I want. No complaints.
2014-11-06 13:53:36	@dami	same with beers
2014-11-06 13:53:46	@dami	think my boss would get mad if i shagged his wife though...
2014-11-06 13:54:02	_glitch	Well, I guess that's just another perk of being self-employed.

2014-11-06 14:06:51	jimi_hendrix	what tiling wm is best for a scrub who doesnt want to spend a ton of time tweaking it?
2014-11-06 14:07:40	thetornainbow	spectrwm
2014-11-06 14:08:00	thetornainbow	it's great out of the box, similar to xmonad and dwm (automatic tilers)
2014-11-06 14:08:02	thetornainbow	i love it
2014-11-06 14:09:02	jimi_hendrix	thetornainbow, how are automatic tilers different from non-automatic ones?
2014-11-06 14:09:29	thetornainbow	they usually follow some certain scheme for placing windows rather than you tell it what you want (manual tiling)
2014-11-06 14:10:08	thetornainbow	so, take i3, which is really popular, you have to specify if you want a space to be split vert or horiz when you open a new window, things like that
2014-11-06 14:10:30	jimi_hendrix	i see
2014-11-06 14:10:39	thetornainbow	it's really preference, as both i3 and spectrwm, and others really don't require any more tweaking than you want to 
2014-11-06 14:10:53	jimi_hendrix	what does spectrwm give you out of the box that others dont?
2014-11-06 14:11:18	ymbx	I spent almsot no time tweaking my wm (i3)
2014-11-06 14:11:36	ymbx	works fine for me
2014-11-06 14:11:37	thetornainbow	sane defaults. dwm and xmonad placement scheme without having to get into C or Haskell source (i think it's haskell). great multi-head support, plain text config
2014-11-06 14:12:35	thetornainbow	i've used it for years and i have only really specified the terminal i want to use, and a few window quirks for windows that are better off floating
2014-11-06 14:12:54	jimi_hendrix	xmonad is haskell
2014-11-06 14:12:55	bwmc	i3 is the only sane tiling wm, awesome/dwm/xmonad etc are just tailored towards ricers
2014-11-06 14:13:07	jimi_hendrix	Cool, will look into it
2014-11-06 14:13:08	thetornainbow	and i like that it stays out of the way, i.e. you don't have to decide where each window goes every time
2014-11-06 14:13:32	thetornainbow	but like i said, it's really all preference
2014-11-06 14:13:38	bwmc	^
2014-11-06 14:13:41	jimi_hendrix	really i want to run a tiling WM then just use it in floating window mode
2014-11-06 14:14:00	thetornainbow	why not a floating WM with some tiling capabilities?
2014-11-06 14:14:01	ymbx	that's pretty dumb
2014-11-06 14:14:09	thetornainbow	^^
2014-11-06 14:14:11	jimi_hendrix	yup
2014-11-06 14:14:51	jimi_hendrix	well i like the minimalist no window decoration look
2014-11-06 14:15:08	thetornainbow	you can get that with most wms
2014-11-06 14:15:15	ymbx	then just install a minimalist theme?

2014-11-06 15:42:10	_glitch	kirby: Yes.
2014-11-06 15:42:24	kirby	I could get it working but ran into the issue that each iteration made a new bar and it used up the x resources really quick.
2014-11-06 15:42:28	jimi_hendrix	_glitch, cool, thanks
2014-11-06 15:42:39	jimi_hendrix	_glitch, why do you use bspwm?

2014-11-06 15:45:12	_glitch	kirby: Ah. I think I had added in the command to launch the bar within the script that launches the bar so it was recursive and got my CPU to 100% in about 30 seconds and all memory and swap in under a minute.

2014-11-06 15:47:01	kirby	Preselection?
2014-11-06 15:47:03	jimi_hendrix	_glitch, so the spaces between windows, is that a config option (put x many pixels between tiled windows), or are the all floating but aligned

2014-11-06 16:34:49	@dami	well, i use ncmpc
2014-11-06 16:35:09	@dami	so i can't help you

2014-11-06 16:35:49	dtch	No, I've been thumbing through the config. there's progressbar_color but it only changes the color of the time left.
2014-11-06 16:37:14	@dami	that's a shitty variable name
2014-11-06 16:37:47	dtch	Is it?
2014-11-06 16:38:48	@dami	well, a progress bar is made up of at least two areas
2014-11-06 16:39:26	@dami	you can have at minimum an empty section (in which case you'd change background colour) and the progress section (which would be the second colour)

2014-11-06 17:02:13	vypr	We had (kinda have, still) a ban on gay marriage.
2014-11-06 17:02:19	vypr	I don't know about civil unions.
2014-11-06 17:02:44	@dami	so, not only is michigan homophobic faggets
2014-11-06 17:02:54	@dami	they're homophobic faggets because they're now a theocracy?
2014-11-06 17:03:05	vypr	Anyways, the Supreme Court struck the ban down as 'unconstitutional,' but our great state government gave our ban an emergency stay so it wouldn't matter what Supreme Court did.
2014-11-06 17:03:26	vypr	Well, our state government is rich white men.
2014-11-06 17:03:28	vypr	So you get the idea.
2014-11-06 17:03:48	vypr	Our governor banned Tesla Motors from selling in Michigan.

2014-11-06 17:05:04	@dami	Tesla D - she'll never had a headache again

2014-11-06 17:05:27	@dami	hue, i could go all night with the Tesla D
2014-11-06 17:05:34	dtch	Her complaints aren't headaches, it's that she doesn't want to have sex.

2014-11-06 17:08:28	vypr	no?

2014-11-06 17:09:02	vypr	i know

2014-11-06 17:09:18	vypr	oh
2014-11-06 17:09:19	vypr	no
2014-11-06 17:10:40	vypr	The good thing about these bans being upheld is that now the U.S. Supreme Court _has_ to do something about gay marriage.
2014-11-06 17:10:54	@dami	unles...
2014-11-06 17:11:03	@dami	dumb dumb duuuuuuuuuuuuuumb
2014-11-06 17:11:31	@dami	the Michigan state court rules that the supreme court ruling of the michigan state court ruling being unconstitutional
2014-11-06 17:11:36	@dami	is
2014-11-06 17:11:38	@dami	per se
2014-11-06 17:11:43	@dami	unconstitutional
2014-11-06 17:12:11	@dami	10th ammendement - fuck yeah! 'murrica
2014-11-06 17:16:07	vypr	and our governor decided to be a dick and say "yeah, all those people who got marriages while the ban was gone, i'm not recognizing them."
2014-11-06 17:19:34	@dami	fuck him
2014-11-06 17:20:56	@dami	how is he not being sued for libel and discrimination?
2014-11-06 17:21:24	vypr	because he's the governor
2014-11-06 17:21:29	vypr	michigan is a republican state
2014-11-06 17:21:31	vypr	just like him
2014-11-06 17:21:46	vypr	so no other gov. official has the balls to do it
2014-11-06 17:21:56	@dami	not in michigan courts obviously
2014-11-06 17:22:04	@dami	in supreme court, or does it have to escalate there?
2014-11-06 17:23:04	@dami	also, such kek because the republicans should really be called conservatives
2014-11-06 17:23:35	vypr	all of it will end up in supreme court
2014-11-06 17:23:51	vypr	since you have the states that won't budge
2014-11-06 17:24:12	vypr	and also
2014-11-06 17:24:35	vypr	congress (which is now 70% republican/conservative) is trying to sue obama
2014-11-06 17:24:46	vypr	and 2 of the lawyers they've tried to do it quit their job
2014-11-06 17:25:38	@dami	if this isn't all a puppet show
2014-11-06 17:26:07	@dami	i'm fucking impressed because dear lord does american politics sound like a huge shambling cluster fuck that should've ended and imploded a long time ago
2014-11-06 17:28:51	dtch	in using git, is it possible to make multiple commits before pushing? e.g; add .weechat/config, commit "update", add .ncmpcpp, commit "update2", push?
2014-11-06 17:29:26	vypr	i think so
2014-11-06 17:30:09	dtch	Yep. Sweet.
2014-11-06 17:30:15	@dami	that's the reason for commits
2014-11-06 17:31:00	@dami	a few nice things are -a (adds all changed files which have already been git added so it won't add a file you just created)
2014-11-06 17:31:13	@dami	and -m which means you don't have to bother with $EDITOR
2014-11-06 17:31:25	dtch	I use -m. Can you elaborate on -a?
2014-11-06 17:31:44	@dami	you have a repository of 2 files. you change 2 files and create a third one 
2014-11-06 17:31:55	@dami	-a will only add the changes done to the original 2 files
2014-11-06 17:32:49	@dami	you have to manually git add the third out

2014-11-06 17:33:15	@dami	also, holy shit was `git checkout <branch_name>` and `git checkout <commit_ref>` useful
2014-11-06 17:33:32	dtch	So, I have files a and b already in my git. I add file f. I change files a and b and use commit -a -m "msg" and it will automatically 'git add a b'?
2014-11-06 17:33:45	@dami	no, it won't, that's what i'm saying
2014-11-06 17:33:57	@dami	oh
2014-11-06 17:33:58	@dami	w8
2014-11-06 17:34:02	@dami	nope, my derp, you're right
2014-11-06 17:34:05	dtch	Lol.
2014-11-06 17:34:09	dtch	Sweet.
2014-11-06 17:34:38	@dami	and git checkout with commit refs is really useful for finding where stuff stopped working
2014-11-06 17:34:41	dtch	I've got another question involving git if you could help. I use it for my configs so is it possible to use a symbolic link and everything still work?
2014-11-06 17:34:55	@dami	it's dirty, but it will work
2014-11-06 17:35:08	@dami	git will only manage the symbolic link, not the file it links too though
2014-11-06 17:35:52	@dami	so you could have two repos and files are symlinked from one to the other
2014-11-06 17:36:18	@dami	to change the symlinked files in one repo, you modify the repo that actually contains the files
2014-11-06 17:37:22	dtch	~/dotfiles is my git repo. If I link ~/.conf to ~/dotfiles/.conf and edit ~/.conf, will ~/dotfiles/.conf update as well? 
2014-11-06 17:38:33	@dami	it will, but git won't keep track of the changes
2014-11-06 17:39:09	dtch	So if I changed ~/.conf and ran git status, it would show no changes?
2014-11-06 17:39:19	@dami	afaik, yes it wouldn't
2014-11-06 17:40:02	dtch	Ah. Crap, then. Is there a way to make it work, or am I stuck with cp'ing my configs to my git?
2014-11-06 17:40:28	@dami	ln -s ~/dotfiles/.conf ~/.conf :)
2014-11-06 17:40:52	@dami	how hard are you kicking yourself now? 
2014-11-06 17:41:03	dtch	Ah.. 
2014-11-06 17:41:19	dtch	Pretty hard, mentally.
2014-11-06 17:41:41	dtch	so, ln -s `source` `target`?
2014-11-06 17:41:44	@dami	very good, it means you're learning. my job is complete
2014-11-06 17:42:29	@dami	yh
2014-11-06 17:43:39	dtch	Alright. Is it possible to link folders/recursively? like ln -s ~/dotfiles/.weechat ~/.weechat ?
2014-11-06 17:46:16	@dami	how about a `man ln`?
2014-11-06 17:46:36	dtch	Honestly, I forget about man.

2014-11-06 18:06:59	ymbx	i thought no?
2014-11-06 18:07:09	@dami	sftp (conventionally means part of the ssh protocol on #nixers) is a different thing altogether
2014-11-06 18:07:13	ymbx	I had a ftp server running for a while
2014-11-06 18:07:22	ymbx	also had openssh running
2014-11-06 18:07:37	@dami	you can sftp with only the ssh daemon running

2014-11-06 18:10:52	ymbx	dami: what are the advantages of sftp over "ftp over ssh" ?
2014-11-06 18:11:03	@dami	both use ssh level security
2014-11-06 18:11:15	@dami	but with ftp over ssh, there's more overhead and you need two daemons running
2014-11-06 18:11:34	@dami	which actually lowers security somewhat because of more stuff to have security bugs
2014-11-06 18:11:41	ymbx	i see
2014-11-06 18:12:13	ymbx	a while ago I transferred files between my desktop and laptop over ssh and I got like ~40MB/s
2014-11-06 18:12:29	ymbx	was that sftp then?
2014-11-06 18:12:49	@dami	what am, a mind reader?
2014-11-06 18:12:58	@dami	i usually get ~40MB/s anyway
2014-11-06 18:13:28	ymbx	well, i had only a ssh server running, not a ftp server

2014-11-06 18:13:35	ymbx	so I'm guessing it must've been sftp then
2014-11-06 18:13:48	@dami	ye
2014-11-06 18:13:58	@dami	plus, ftp is shit if you're doing a large amount of files
2014-11-06 18:14:04	@dami	sftp isn't perfect, but there's less overhead
2014-11-06 18:14:11	ymbx	well, if you'd said you'd get 110MB/s easy 2% cpu, i'd doubt myself
2014-11-06 18:14:41	@dami	nah
2014-11-06 18:14:51	@dami	your disk probably has a 40MB/s transfer limit
2014-11-06 18:14:58	ymbx	lolno
2014-11-06 18:14:59	@dami	but yeah, your cpu shouldn't spike for simple I/O
2014-11-06 18:15:13	ymbx	it was totally my cpu that was the bottleneck
2014-11-06 18:15:32	@dami	that's...
2014-11-06 18:15:33	@dami	odd
2014-11-06 18:15:54	ymbx	i just attributed it to the ssh nature of the connection
2014-11-06 18:16:45	ymbx	have you transferred big files between pc's over lan via ssh?
2014-11-06 18:17:46	@dami	yeah, i usually get about 35MB/s from the raid
2014-11-06 18:17:51	@dami	40MB/s from the single drive
2014-11-06 18:18:07	ymbx	and you didn't think that was very low?
2014-11-06 18:21:12	ymbx	most modern drives read/write about 80~100MB/s for big files
2014-11-06 18:21:18	ymbx	HDDs that is
2014-11-06 18:21:43	@dami	sequential writes, yeah
2014-11-06 18:21:55	@dami	it could be that the encryption is making the CPU spike
2014-11-06 18:22:13	@dami	but i don't think that's the case

2014-11-06 18:24:36	ymbx	yeah, i'm sure (i think)
2014-11-06 18:25:19	ymbx	bwmc: https://i.imgur.com/M4EMI8z.jpg
2014-11-06 18:27:14	@dami	bwmc: no, it's raining outside and my parents aren't asleep :/
2014-11-06 18:27:38	@dami	ymbx: at 40mb/s i have about 1.50 CPU load
2014-11-06 18:27:54	@dami	and it's an athlon X2 from 6-7 or more years back running openbsd
2014-11-06 18:28:08	@dami	so i don't know what's going on, but you have some serious shit all up in somewhere
2014-11-06 18:28:12	ymbx	1.5% ?
2014-11-06 18:28:19	@dami	1.50 out of 4.0
2014-11-06 18:28:33	ymbx	yeah, that's about what I got
2014-11-06 18:28:35	@dami	ie. 4 cores, which means you need a load of 4 to load all cores to 100%
2014-11-06 18:28:40	@dami	>cpu cry
2014-11-06 18:28:41	bwmc	http://i.imgur.com/iqVhdls.jpg
2014-11-06 18:28:55	ymbx	dami: yeah, ok, that was overstated
2014-11-06 18:28:58	@dami	cpu's cry at above 100% load, no/
2014-11-06 18:29:01	@dami	ok then
2014-11-06 18:29:18	ymbx	dami: did one core max out?
2014-11-06 18:29:28	@dami	but, if it's not being loaded up to 100%, it should be able to go faster which means something else is going on
2014-11-06 18:29:31	@dami	not for long
2014-11-06 18:29:31	@dami	no
2014-11-06 18:30:03	ymbx	well, it could just be that it's written sequentially (not parralized)
2014-11-06 18:30:12	ymbx	so it can't take advantage of multiple cores
2014-11-06 18:30:14	@dami	parallelised
2014-11-06 18:30:15	@dami	*
2014-11-06 18:30:22	ymbx	lol thx
2014-11-06 18:30:27	@dami	ok
2014-11-06 18:30:34	@dami	was a core maxed out on yours? because it wasn't on mine
2014-11-06 18:30:43	ymbx	I'm not sure
2014-11-06 18:31:00	ymbx	I don't think it was on my laptop, which had 4 virtual cores
2014-11-06 18:31:14	@dami	>Consider that a typical, modern 500 GB drive will likely be able to sustain data transfer rates somewhere in the neighborhood of ~65 MB/s. While it might burst faster at the start of the drive, it will slow down throughout the transfer. The data located at the end of the drive will read even slower, perhaps in the neighborhood of ~45 MB/s. 
2014-11-06 18:31:33	ymbx	lol bullshit
2014-11-06 18:31:48	@dami	that was written in 2009
2014-11-06 18:31:56	@dami	which is about the average age of my drives :)
2014-11-06 18:32:17	ymbx	I did a dd to one of my harddrives (250gb 5400rpm laptop drive) for its entire length
2014-11-06 18:32:34	ymbx	write got about ~70MB/s at the end I think
2014-11-06 18:32:48	@dami	well done, you have a fast drive
2014-11-06 18:32:53	ymbx	no
2014-11-06 18:32:57	@dami	most of mine are wd caviar blue level
2014-11-06 18:33:05	ymbx	it's an old shitty laptop hdd
2014-11-06 18:33:45	@dami	http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/internal-hard-drives/1279462/western-digital-caviar-blue-1tb
2014-11-06 18:33:51	@dami	>Small files were written at a sluggish 54.5MB/s and read at a slow 44MB/s
2014-11-06 18:34:07	@dami	also, what do you mean you dd'd to the entire drive?
2014-11-06 18:34:16	ymbx	we weren't talking about small files lel
2014-11-06 18:34:30	@dami	oh how naive you are
2014-11-06 18:34:38	ymbx	> reading large files with a score of just less than 109MB/s
2014-11-06 18:34:50	@dami	and how do you think sftp does its thing?
2014-11-06 18:34:59	@dami	does it read the whole file into memory and then encrypt it?
2014-11-06 18:35:08	ymbx	i have no fucking clue how sftp does it's thing
2014-11-06 18:35:14	ymbx	its*
2014-11-06 18:35:21	@dami	exactly, sftp is pure small files
2014-11-06 18:35:37	@dami	take a chunk, encrypt it and send it off on its merry way then rinse and repeat until EOF
2014-11-06 18:36:06	@dami	ftp should do the same thing sans encryption
2014-11-06 18:36:09	ymbx	so whats the piece size then?
2014-11-06 18:36:21	@dami	<1mb probably, iunno
2014-11-06 18:37:18	@dami	but you have to consider the ramifications of TCP and a your router not being a gigabit router (or just shit) etc. etc. etc.
2014-11-06 18:37:37	ymbx	meh, i don't think so
2014-11-06 18:37:43	ymbx	it's gigabit or it's not
2014-11-06 18:38:05	ymbx	if it is, speed will be ~110MB/s, if it's not it'll probably be 11MB/s
2014-11-06 18:38:06	@dami	not necessarily
2014-11-06 18:38:18	@dami	12.5 and 125*
2014-11-06 18:38:20	@dami	but more to the point
2014-11-06 18:38:29	@dami	a singular transfer could reach gigabit speeds on a shitty router
2014-11-06 18:38:43	ymbx	nah, overhead comes in, making it ~11 and not 12.5
2014-11-06 18:38:47	@dami	but three at 125/3MB/s could choke it with the big fat dick of overload
2014-11-06 18:39:10	ymbx	i dunno about that
2014-11-06 18:39:33	ymbx	router are typically great at lan transfers
2014-11-06 18:39:43	ymbx	(wan is different)
2014-11-06 18:40:19	@dami	how?
2014-11-06 18:40:35	ymbx	internet traffic requires things lan transfers don't
2014-11-06 18:40:40	@dami	oh
2014-11-06 18:40:49	@dami	yeah, that doesn't matter to the router though
2014-11-06 18:41:02	@dami	to the router it's exactly the same except it sends it off through a different cabl
2014-11-06 18:41:05	@dami	e
2014-11-06 18:41:11	ymbx	nope, it's very different
2014-11-06 18:41:19	@dami	>.>
2014-11-06 18:41:25	@dami	it's not TO THE ROUTER
2014-11-06 18:41:35	ymbx	most low-end routers can't even reach 200mbit on wan traffic
2014-11-06 18:41:48	ymbx	but they can do lan transfers at 1gbit
2014-11-06 18:41:55	@dami	i agree, there's a whole bunch more stuff in the way
