2014-10-27 20:51:54	Score_Under	Renf, generally "sudo -i" and "su" (launching a shell as root) are not as unsafe as logging in as root because there's far less temptation to launch non-vital processes (each a further link, possibly a weak one, in the security chain). However, sudo's 3 statement lecture applies - remember to think before you type. This also applies to sudo and 'su -c' to an extent

2014-10-28 11:04:49	thenewbguy	Hey guys, is it generally a good idea to hold off on configuration until after you "cover your bases" and get a basic environment set up? e.g. installing a working display server, wm/de, browser?

That said, you can generally trigger or hook a screensaver unlock event, but getting the credentials entered into the screensaver... whether that's passable to another program is entirely different

2014-10-28 11:10:48	vodik	so i wonder if the crash is because it doesnt work, or because it tries when gpg doesn't allow it
2014-10-28 11:10:57	vodik	or both :)
